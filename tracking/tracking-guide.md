## A guide to improving tracking

I've seen a lot of improper advice given to beginners (or anyone) for improving their tracking. You probably heard about *"being smooth"* and how that's proper tracking technique. Now, that isn't wrong, but this saying fails to understand HOW and WHY you should *"be smooth"*.

When you're told to be smooth, you probably imagine yourself smoothly gliding your finger across the screen, hoping that, by being smooth, you'll magically land your shots on that target. After all, good aimers appear smooth, right? **The problem is, this just isn't how it works**. When tracking, you need to be fast, steady, and accurate. When you try to *"be smooth"*, you fail pretty much all of these, maybe not so much the steady part.

**The reason it doesn't work is because smoothness in itself is just what proper tracking looks like, not what you actually perform**. Physical smoothness isn't something you should be worrying about, because developing *"smoothness"* comes from getting better at tracking and aiming as a whole.

To get better at tracking, first we need to break it down into its 2 core aspects

### 1. Speed matching

**Speed matching is the ability to match the target's velocity (it's speed + direction)**. This sounds simple, but can be rather hard when it comes to a target that's

*a*. constantly changing direction
and
*b*. constantly changing speed (generally by acceleration)

The best way to practice this, is to just **focus on mimicking the target's movement** with your finger. You'll get better at this as you keep the concept of speed matching in mind

Speed matching can also have a **process of accelerating and decelerating your aim to match the target's velocity**. This is because, in many games and aim training scenarios, the targets have movement acceleration. When a target has movement acceleration and changes direction, its speed will change through a process of decelerating and accelerating. **It's possible to "predict" a direction change due to this**, as the target will first decelerate in its current direction, then accelerate in the next direction.

As long as you're paying attention to speed matching, you will be able to match the acceleration as well.

You might notice however, that you jitter, especially in longer *"predictable"* movements, almost as if the target (and your surroundings) are vibrating. This might seem like a physical issue, but it's actually not. This *"jitter"* comes from poor speed matching. **You jitter because you're constantly either going too fast or too slow**, causing you to rapidly fall off the target. Then, you (naturally) go to correct yourself, but since you're not speed matching well, it happens again, and again... and so on.
So if you find yourself jittering, just remember to focus on speed matching the target.

*(On the other hand, this jittering can actually be seen as a good thing, because it means you're able to quickly correct your aim back on target. However, good tracking also comes from proper speed matching, not just correcting)*

### 2. Correction/adjustment

**Your *"correction"* is the motion you perform to get back onto the target due to falling off**, because of direction and/or speed changes. Performing this is another commonly misunderstood part of tracking. You need to be fast, you need to be accurate. However, you again hear to be *"smooth"* and to *"not flick"* while correcting. As mentioned before, this isn't entirely wrong, but it causes you to misunderstand how to actually correct.

The first part of correcting is the flick back onto the target. When we need to acquire a target, or in this case reacquire, we do a fast motion (a flick) onto or near the target. We do the same in tracking as well. However, you have to understand that we aren't flicking like we would in static switching.

In static switching, the targets are typically far apart and requires you to flick a large distance before you can land onto them. For our correction, instead imagine static switching but the targets are very close together. If we flick too fast (apply too much pressure), we'll overshoot the target. Since the targets are very close together, we only need to apply a little bit of pressure. It's still a fast motion because the targets are close together.

So for our correction, **we need to flick with only a little bit of pressure**. The closer your crosshair is to the target, the less pressure. We do this because when you fall off target, you're actually very close to it, and all you need to do is a small movement to get back onto it. **The faster you are at doing this, the less distance you'll cover**, meaning less pressure in our flick to correct.

A beginner will see themselves fall off target, and try to reacquire it fast, but instead of paying attention to the distance, they will just flick with a lot of pressure to be *"fast"*, causing them to overshoot. When they're told to *"be smooth"*, they instead don't flick at all, which causes their correction to be too slow.

To get better at correcting, **you'll need to pay attention to how far you are from target and learn the pressure needed to correct yourself back onto target**. Remember that the better/faster you are at correcting, the less pressure you'll need, as you're going to be very close to the target.

## TL;DR

* Mimic the target's movement with your finger

* Understand that when you fall off target, **you do not need to flick a large distance** to get back on target

* Smoothness comes from good tracking, not something you physically do
